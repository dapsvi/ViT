# ViT
A simple ViT implementation in python with Pytorch leading to 93.5% accuracy on FashionMNIST after only 100 epochs. The same model achieved the same accuracy on the MNIST dataset after only 5 epochs.

## Requirements
- Recommended, but optional : a CUDA-capable device
- `torch`, `torchvision`, `einops`

## How to adapt the code for yourself
You will need to change the dataset at the top of the code as well as some hyperparameters/values in the ViT's `__init__` method.
